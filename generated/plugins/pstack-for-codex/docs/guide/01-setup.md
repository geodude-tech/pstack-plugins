# Set up pstack

In this page you install the plugin, pick which models pstack uses, and run your first task. Setup is one command plus a short conversation.

## Install the plugin

In a Cursor chat, run:

```text
/add-plugin pstack
```

Cursor confirms the plugin is installed.

## Pick your models

Run:

```text
$setup-pstack
```

[`$setup-pstack`](../../skills/setup-pstack/SKILL.md) detects the models you have access to, shows you each role (code delegates, judgment, the review panels), and asks what you want. Answer the questions. It writes `~/.codex/pstack-models.md`, a small rule every pstack skill reads.

You only override what you care about. A role with no line in the rule keeps the skill's default. To restore a default later, delete that role's line, or just run `$setup-pstack` again.

You might be wondering what happens if you use Auto. Set a role to `inherit-parent` or `auto` and pstack omits the subagent `model` field, so the subagent inherits your parent chat model. Both values mean the same thing, and neither is a model slug. For a panel role the value is a list, and one subagent runs per entry, so the list length sets the panel size. Setup also configures `swarm workers`, the default model for every `$swarm` worker unless a race names a model for each arm.

## Accept the verification offer, or don't

At the end of setup, `$setup-pstack` looks for a way to prove app behavior in your project, either a `verify-*` skill or an existing harness. If it finds neither, it offers once to generate one with [`$create-verification-skill`](../../skills/create-verification-skill/SKILL.md).

Say yes and it writes `.cursor/skills/verify-<app>/`, a project-local skill that teaches agents to drive your app the way a user does. It proves the skill works once before handing it over. Say no and setup moves on. You can run `$create-verification-skill` yourself any time. [Verify and ship](./06-verify-and-ship.md#create-a-project-verification-skill) covers when it earns its place.

After setup, start a new chat. The model rule applies to new sessions.

## Run your first task

Pick something real but small, and describe it the way you'd describe it to a colleague:

```text
$poteto-mode add a --json flag to this command. text output stays byte-identical. verify both.
```

Watch the todo list. Its first items are the matched playbook's steps copied in, the Feature playbook for this prompt. If `$poteto-mode` skips a step, the step stays in the list with `skip: <reason>`, so you can see what it chose not to do.

From here you can type normal follow-ups. `$poteto-mode` is sticky. It stays on for the conversation until you opt out by saying so.

Next: [Route work through `$poteto-mode`](./02-poteto-mode.md).

## Codex model routing

Before delegating, read `~/.codex/pstack-models.md` if it exists. Its per-role choices override these defaults.

| Role alias | Model | Reasoning effort |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pstack-judgment | gpt-6-astra | low |
| pstack-fast | gpt-5.6-luna | high |
| pstack-balanced | gpt-5.6-sol | medium |

These aliases are routing labels, not model IDs or registered agent types. Resolve an alias before spawning and pass the model and reasoning effort separately using the available subagent tool. With `collaboration.spawn_agent`, use `model` and `reasoning_effort`; explicit overrides require `fork_turns` to be `none` or a positive turn count, with sufficient task context in the prompt.

Check the session's available models and effort levels before spawning. If a configured pair is unavailable, ask for a supported replacement. For `inherit-parent` or `auto`, omit both overrides. If the host cannot select a model or effort, report that limitation rather than claim the requested routing was applied.

Keep every panel entry, including repeated aliases, as a separate agent. These defaults do not provide cross-provider diversity; do not claim that repeated roles are different model families.
