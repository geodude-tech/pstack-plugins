### Perf issue

**You own the measurement story. Plan, review, verify the numbers.** Tie every fix to a measurement, don't read source instead of measuring.

1. Capture a baseline trace via the matching control skill.
2. `how` to ground hypotheses. Don't claim a perf ceiling without running it first.
   Most fixes come from eight strategy families. Use them as hypothesis generators, not a checklist. A family earns an attempt only when the trace shows the signal it names.
   - **Elimination.** Before optimizing the hot path, ask whether it needs to exist: a computation nobody consumes, a feature gate that's always off for this user, a sync that redundantly mirrors state, a legacy path kept "just in case". The trace shows what's slow, never that it's deletable, so this family needs the `how` pass, not the profiler.
   - **Divide and conquer.** The dominant cost scales with input size. Split the work so each piece touches less (chunk, shard, prune the search space) or so independent pieces run in parallel.
   - **Caching.** The same computation or fetch repeats on identical inputs. Store and reuse the result. Name what invalidates it before claiming the win.
   - **Indirection.** The hot path does expensive work a cheaper intermediate could absorb: an index instead of a scan, a queue that shifts work off the interactive thread, a handle that lets a cheaper implementation swap in. Add the hop only when it removes more from the critical path than it adds.
   - **Batching.** Many small operations each pay a fixed overhead (RPC, query, syscall, draw call). Coalesce them to pay the overhead once per batch.
   - **Redundancy.** The wait hangs on one slow instance or attempt. Duplicate the work (replicas, hedged requests, speculative execution) and take the fastest result. The trace has to show the wait dominates and the system has headroom.
   - **Lazy evaluation.** Cost lands on results that are never used or not needed yet (eager init on the boot path, rendering offscreen items). Defer the work until first use.
   - **Scheduling.** The work must happen, but not during the interactive moment. Move it to where nobody is waiting: idle callbacks, a background warmup after boot, precompute before the user arrives, cleanup after the frame commits. The win is perceived latency, so measure the interactive path, not total work done.
3. Plan the fix from the trace. If it crosses a function boundary, `architect` first. Delegate implementation to a subagent using your configured perf-issue model (default `pstack-judgment`). Review the diff. Capture a post-fix trace.
   Apply the **sequence-verifiable-units** principle skill, verifying each attempt before trying the next.
4. Parse and compare the artifacts (JSON to sqlite, diff). "Inconclusive" or wrong-surface is not a pass. Flag it.
5. Cite the measurement in the PR.
6. Run **Opening a PR**.

For sustained improvement against a metric rather than a one-off fix, use the Hillclimb playbook (`playbooks/hillclimb.md`).

**Reply:** baseline number, post-fix number, delta, artifact path.

## Codex model routing

Before delegating, read `~/.codex/pstack-models.md` if it exists. Its per-role choices override these defaults.

| Role alias | Model | Reasoning effort |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pstack-judgment | gpt-6-astra | low |
| pstack-fast | gpt-5.6-luna | high |
| pstack-balanced | gpt-5.6-sol | medium |

These aliases are routing labels, not model IDs or registered agent types. Resolve an alias before spawning and pass the model and reasoning effort separately using the available subagent tool. With `collaboration.spawn_agent`, use `model` and `reasoning_effort`; explicit overrides require `fork_turns` to be `none` or a positive turn count, with sufficient task context in the prompt.

Check the session's available models and effort levels before spawning. If a configured pair is unavailable, ask for a supported replacement. For `inherit-parent` or `auto`, omit both overrides. If the host cannot select a model or effort, report that limitation rather than claim the requested routing was applied.

Keep every panel entry, including repeated aliases, as a separate agent. These defaults do not provide cross-provider diversity; do not claim that repeated roles are different model families.
